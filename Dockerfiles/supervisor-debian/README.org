#+TITLE: supervisor

Experimental

Image based on  debian:wheezy

Base image, copied from Quinten Krijger's [[https://github.com/Krijger/docker-cookbooks/tree/master/supervisor][supervisor]].

Build image:

: docker build -t michieljoris/supervisor .

This image and images based on it start the supervisor deamon, no matter what.

Build new images by starting your new Docker file with:

: FROM michieljoris/supervisor

and ending it with

: COPY imagename.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/imagename.conf

=appname= can be anything, however it should match a file in the same dir as
the Dockerfile named =appname.conf=

The contents should be something like:

: [program:appname]
: command=/command/to/start/app parm1 parm2

Test the image with:

: docker run --name supervisor michieljoris/supervisor

or run your app: 

: docker run -d --name appname appname

This will start the app. If it is a deamonized app the docker container won't
die, the supervisor process will keep it alive.
